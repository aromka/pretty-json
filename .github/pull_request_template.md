This only works if the pull request is issued from the repo owner.
If you want to update screenshots, please make sure to run the following command before creating the pull request:
```bash
npm run test
```

You probably can't run on all platforms required. After making a pull request, the repo owner can make a follow up pull request to update the screenshots.
